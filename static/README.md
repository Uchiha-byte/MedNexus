# MEDNEXUS Logo

To add your MEDNEXUS logo to the application:

1. Place your logo image file in this directory with the name `mednexus_logo.png`
2. The recommended logo dimensions are:
   - Width: 200-300 pixels
   - Height: proportional to width
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - File size: Optimize for web (under 100KB)

If no logo file is found, the application will display a text-based header with the MEDNEXUS name and tagline.
